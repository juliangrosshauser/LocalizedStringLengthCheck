LocalizedStringLengthCheck analyzes localized strings and warns if a string became significantly longer after translation.  
These longer strings maybe need a double check when doing UI testing.  
You can find more information about length changes of localized strings in [IBM's Globalization Guidelines](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/guidelines/a3.html).
